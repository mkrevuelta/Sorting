# Sorting
Explanation and implementation of a few sorting algorithms, some well known, others not so much.

## History

I started this project in 2013. It was happily hosted in Google Code until 2015, when they finally shut it down.

The original project name was "combsortcs2p-and-other-sorting-algorithms". By that time I was playing with Combsort variants.

## Current state

I plan to adapt all the contents to GitHub, starting with [Heapsort](doc/en/HeapSort.md), and then [Smoothsort](doc/en/SmoothSort.md). But first I must adapt the pages about [computational complexity](doc/en/BigOhNotation.md)...

Stay tuned ;-)
